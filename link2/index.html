    <p>Physical Geography as a science is experiencing a radical change in philosophy.
         It is changing from a science that was highly descriptive to one that is increasingly experimental and theoretical.
          This transition represents a strong desire by Physical Geographers to understand the processes that cause the patterns or forms we see in nature.
    </p>


    <p>.In Physical Geography, and all other sciences, most questions that deal with why are usually queries about process. Some level of understanding about process can be derived from basic descriptive data.
         Process is best studied, however, through experimental manipulation and hypothesis testing. By 1950, Physical Geographers were more interested in figuring out process than just collecting descriptive facts about the world.
          This attitude is even more prevalent today because of our growing need to understand how humans are changing the Earth and its environment.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, as mentioned above, a deeper understanding of process normally requires the use of hypothesis testing, experimental methods, and statistics. As a result, the standard undergraduate and graduate curriculum in Physical Geography exposes students to this type of knowledge so they can better ask the question why?
